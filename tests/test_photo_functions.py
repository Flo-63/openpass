class TestPhoto:
    """
    TestPhoto class contains the implementation of test cases for handling photo-related operations in a web application.

    The class includes tests for scenarios such as uploading a photo, attempting uploads without providing a file,
    deleting photos, and retrieving photos. Additionally, it defines fixtures like mock photo creation and user session
    setup required for the test cases. The class ensures functionality and error handling of photo operations via various
    test cases.
