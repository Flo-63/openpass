class TestOAuthRoutes:
    """
    Class for testing OAuth routes.

    This class contains test cases to ensure the proper functioning of OAuth login
    and callback endpoints. Each test examines a specific scenario to validate the
    behavior and responses of the OAuth-related workflows. This includes testing
    the start of the OAuth login process, handling of invalid states in the
    callback, and scenarios where the token is missing in the process.

    Attributes:
        None

        """
        Tests the initiation of the OAuth login process.

        This function tests if the OAuth login flow starts correctly by sending
        a GET request to the designated OAuth login endpoint. It verifies the
        response status code and checks the session for the presence of the
        OAuth state.

        Parameters:

        Tests the handling of an OAuth callback with an invalid state.

        This function simulates an HTTP GET request to the OAuth callback endpoint

        expected HTTP 400 Bad Request status code.
